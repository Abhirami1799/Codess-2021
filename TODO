DONE-1.  Implement weights -

    PROCEDURE:
        Put a 'Weight Node' button along with the other tool-mode-input buttons, i.e., Start Node, End Node, Wall Node.
        Add new TOOL MODE in States.js called WEIGHT_NODE.
        Create a function in 'Box' class called setAsWeight().
        Update perform() in Runner class.
        Update fixGrid() in Grid class, resetGrid() in Runner class, and check other functions.

DONE-2. Implement stations -

    PROCEDURE:
        Add this.arrayOfInter = [] in Grid class constructor.
        All the above.
        In setAsStation(), after setting the nodeType, push it into arrayOfInter in Grid class.

3. Fix IDAStar

>>4. Implement Bi-Directional algorithms

DONE-5. Make the algorithm panel Draggable

>>6. Take Multiple Stops input for w

>>7. Heuristic cannot be Manhattan for diagonal

>>8. Integrate pathCount in Path class

>>9. Make info panel draggable

ERRORS:

1. Station setting and removing

2. Sometimes, one or two stations are left out of the path - Multiple Stops and Traveling Salesman.

3. Random Grid - end node disappears.
